    "## Document Structure and Initial Stats\n",
    "First, we'll look at the expected document and database structures before and after. After that, we can dive into the tags, and make a cleanup plan for some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build our JSON document, we skip the outer tags (\"osm\", \"note\", \"meta\", and \"bounds\") and focus on the three main elements (\"node\", \"way\", and \"relation\") for top-level documents, loading them into a single MongoDB collection. Their attributes and subelements (\"tag\", \"nd\", and \"member\") are their subdocuments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Element creation attributes (\"changeset\", \"timestamp\", \"uid\", \"user\", and \"version\") become keys in one subdocument called \"created\". Node lattitude and longitude form a single positional vector array under the \"pos\" key. The \"ref\" attribute of the \"nd\" subelements similarly form a list under the \"node_refs\" key of way documents. Relation elements' \"member\" subelements go into a list of subdocuments with their attribute keys (\"re\", \"role\", \"type\").\n",
    "\n",
    "While tag elements only have \"k\" and \"v\" attributes, they have the messiest range of possible values that pose structural challenges as well as copy editing challenges. This is where we focus our cleanup efforts. Unlike other elements, we drop tag attribute keys, and use their values as keys and values in the JSON document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's get a bird's eye view of the document. Since we're cleaning up before loading into MongoDB, we'll just make some quick and dirty pandas dataframes for this initial analyis. One thing worth noting is that nodes are the most common top-level element, which the nd element is the most common element, which means some nodes get referenced more than once."

    "A few things quickly stand out. Some of them have to do with restructuring XML into JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Colon-separated keys\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, many keys have colon-separated values that represent a hierarchical structure (e.g. \"addr:street=\" and \"addr:state=\"). These keys can be subdivided into lower-order documents. But, not all keys like this can be subdivided so easily. Some of the parent prefixes are also keys that stand alone and have their own values (e.g. \"turn=\", \"turn:lane=\"). We would need to create a child key identical to the parent key. This might have undesirable effects. That said, this might be a moot point if we were to group tags by parent elements. Since I have no analytical or use goals for this database, I chose to only subdivide a select list of keys in which the parents never stand alone: addr, cost, fire_hydrant, fuel, payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to decide which tags have list values and which have scalar values. A starting point might be to identify those with semicolon-separated values by searching for values with semicolons. If you were to programmatically search for semicolons, you'd still need to look manually in those values that might employ a semicolon as natural language rather than as a separator, such as in \"note\" and \"description\" tags. Plus, what about those tags that warrant a list but happen to only have a scalar value in this extract? Rather than developing (or finding) an AI for this task, I decided to put eyes on each tag, consulting the wiki as necessary, and make a list by hand. That said, I did run a search for semicolons to catch some tags that I might have missed. Again, I'm only doing this part casually to create some problems to solve, beyond what's required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other candidates for creating list values are those tags with keys that end in an underscore and a number, indicating multiple values for the same type of tag (e.g. 'name_1'). I compiled this list programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"is_in\" key and all of its children is another quick check. We could omit it since this extract is exlcusive to Bellingham, WA. But, hypothetically, this data might be joined to other extracts, so I left it in and mapped it to standard value strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any key with a \"conditional\" suffix has a list.\n",

    "    \n",
    "The \"contact\" prefix is deprecated, so I removed it. These keys should hold list values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Finally, I substituted some miscellaneous keys for others, due to deprecation, misuse, redundancy, etc. However, I'm choosing to leave the \"tiger\", \"gnis\", and \"nist\" tags alone in lieu of forming a broader plan for them. I did fix a couple of gnis typos.\n",

According to the OSM wiki, these links would be better placed in a \"wiki:symbol\" tag. There's some question about the proper way to link to images in the \"wiki:symbol\" tag. The OSM wiki entry on the tag states that these should only be filenames of files uploaded to the OSM wiki, not to external sites. No examples of this method exist in this extract, though. Most of the links do have identical filenames to identical symbols on the OSM wiki, so they could easily be stripped of their paths. However, one link does not and needs to be uploaded to OSM. I might do that once I gain that account privilege. In the meantime, a few forum users have stated, contrary to the OSM wiki article, that a link to wikimedia is fine. So, I just assigned the links to the appropriate key.\n",

    "I found a long list of other copy edits to make, typos and formatting issues mostly. Some of which I handled. See the cleanup script for a commented list of what I left unhandled.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also created a laundry list of stickier issues that aren't simply edits to be made, and that I will not likely fix. They may require a FIXME tag in the OSM data, or an executive/team decision with regard for the intended use of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the OSM wiki doesn't include the \"wheelchair:entrance_width\" and \"wheelchair:step_height\" tags. They therefore have no default unit, and the tags in the extract don't give units. OSM defaults to metric units, but this is a U.S. dataset, so the contributor may have used imperial units. This warrants issuing a FIXME tag in the element, and perhaps creating a page on the wiki if no sufficient alternative tag exists. It also may fit nicely into the following category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Field trips and curiosities\n",
    "\n",
    "I collected some cases of what I'm calling \"field trips and curiosities.\" They include unexpected values that beckon a closer look at the data, if not also an investigation \"in real life\" (e.g. \"width\": \"Cedar Jumps Green Line\", \"maxspeed\": \"127\", \"start_date\": \"0000\"). Some of them just need a phone call for business hours or a bike ride with a tape measure. Data wrangling sometimes requires boots on the ground to establish ground truth.\n",
